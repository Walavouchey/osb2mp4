# osb2mp4

An [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) storyboard to video converter. ~~Will be maintained until an alternative exists in lazer.~~ Very much unmaintained, pending rewrite.

This project has been in progress on and off since the middle of September 2020. Actual time spent working so far has probably been about 6 weeks.

I'll expand this readme eventually. Here are some benchmarks on my computer:

```
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2400G @ 3.70 GHz
Render: 1920x1080 @ 30fps
CPU usage: ~90-95%
```

## TODO

- handle errors
- fix all edge-cases
- clean up dumb code
- optimise for performance a bit
- rewrite whole thing in opengl or something

## Dependencies

- [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org/releases) - download and extract somewhere accessible
- A global [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installation

## Compilation

On Windows, you can compile with clang (you can get it by installing [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)) by running the included `make.ps1` script. Be sure to fill in the templated variables at the top of the file.

When running, make sure to have `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg451_64.dll` and `opencv_world451.dll` in the same folder as `osb2mp4.exe`.
